Memo about the Ansible configuration management system.

* What is Ansible?

Simply put, Ansible is an agent-less configuration management, deployment,
and orchestration tool.


* Why Ansible?

We choose Ansible instead of more popular Puppet mainly becasue:
 - no additional software is required on production machines;
   only needed on administrator's control machine;
 - no server or client daemons are required: it just use existing SSHd;
 - it is much simpler!


* To install Ansible on administrator's console,
  see INSTALL.txt for more details.
