development               # inventory file for development environment

group_vars/
   group1                 # here we assign variables to particular groups
   group2                 # ""
   all                    # any default values or universally true values
host_vars/
   hostname1              # if systems need specific variables, put them here
   hostname2              # ""

webservers.yml            # playbook for webserver tier
dbservers.yml             # playbook for dbserver tier

roles/
    common/               # this hierarchy represents a "role"
        tasks/            #
